    Inforamtion Criterion

Description: This packages computes sparse estimates for Cox PH models via
    MIC, a short name for "Minimizing approxiamted Inforatmion Criterion". MIC
    mimics the best subset selection using a penalized likelihood approach yet
    with no need of a tuning parameter. The problem is further reformulated with
    a reparameterization step so that it reduces to one unconstrained nonconvex
    yet smooth programming problem, which can be solved efficiently. Furthermore,
    the reparameterization tactic yields an additional advantage in terms of
    circumventing postselection inference.
